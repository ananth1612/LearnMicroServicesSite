    <pre>\n(AWS) actually is and why its useful to you as a Java programmer.\n\nAmazon Web Services are a bunch of products that Amazon is offering \nto make our lives as programmers easier.\n\nThese products come in the form of web applications that help us to do \nthe un-fun stuff of programming.\n\nMostly it involves what we call the dev ops (development operations), \nwhich are the processes that we use to make sure that our code can be properly enjoyed by all of our users.\n\nTo put it simply, AWS helps us to put our applications on the public web for anyone \nto access and enjoy.\n\nTypically when were coding, were firing up a web server privately on our own laptops / desktops. \nWe have a Tomcat server installed somewhere that runs our code on localhost:8080 and we code like happy little monkeys.\n\nBut what happens when we finish our application and were ready to show it to the world?\n Sure we can upload it to GitHub, but thats only to be enjoyed by other programmers we want our family and friends (and complete strangers) to use our apps and tell us how amazing we all are, right?\n\nRight.\n\nYou get the idea.</pre>\n</div>"
